A simple Python tool that compresses and decompresses text using **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm.

---

## üîß Features

- Builds Huffman Tree from text
- Generates binary codes for each character
- Compresses text into bytes
- Decompresses back to original
- Shows compression stats and tree visualization

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Count** character frequencies  
2. **Build** Huffman Tree using a min-heap  
3. **Assign** binary codes via tree traversal  
4. **Encode** text into binary & compress  
5. **Decode** compressed binary back to text
